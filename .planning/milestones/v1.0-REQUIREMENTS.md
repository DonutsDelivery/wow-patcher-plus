- [x] **DL-04**: Downloads can resume if interrupted (where host supports)
- [x] **DL-05**: Multiple patches can download in parallel

### Installation

- [x] **INST-03**: User can repair/re-apply patches on demand

- [x] **UI-04**: App builds as native executable for macOS
- [x] **UI-05**: App uses dark mode theme

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### User Interface

- **UI-V2-01**: System tray / background operation
- **UI-V2-02**: Light theme option

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Auto-detect Turtle WoW updates | User triggers repair manually |
| CLI interface | GUI only for now |
| Hosting patch files | Scrape existing forum links instead |
